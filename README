INSTALLATION:


1. Unzip
2. copy to your moodleroot directory, keeping the directory structure

These files will be overwritten:

lib/weblib.php *
lib/editor/htmlarea/htmlarea.php
lib/editor/htmlarea/dialog.js

* Overwriting weblib.php is OPTIONAL: 

If you choose to include this modified weblib.php, the CLOZE-editor button will only show for teachers, and only in quiz-question-interfaces. In any other editor instances, and for students, it will be hidden.

If you refrain from overwriting weblib.php, it will still work, but the editor button will be visible in EVERY editor instance for teachers, but not for students.
